# Activity Log
> THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. Currently working on formatting the documentation and deciding if I should use some of the documentation for content or share right away. But it's done! 

> I created my own system for processing my tasks and activities and rating them based on my goals, values, and interests to help me gauge whether or not I should pursue a task or not. 

> this one is for all the indecisive adhd asd people who can't ever choose.  

> **ALSO**: this will help you notice patterns in behavior by allowing for a way to not only look at activities and mood. but also to link them to your values and goals. you will be able to see how your mood is linked to your actions and be able to tell if it's because you were more drained. if so why. what activity were you doing. this is free and it's just the first version. I haven't tested but have to push this asap to get it out so test on your own for now. 


## Creating an Activity Log 
> This activity log will contain the information that will be stored and used to help track my moods and activities throughout the day

### Why? 
- To allow for visualization of the data to see relationships between things I'm doing and how it affects my mood
- To add features to the current app that only allows for activities to be rated and grouped. Example:
    1. To Allow for clearer groupings of moods and activities without redundancies
    2. To create a data model that can be expanded to include a task management system. The system maps the data onto values and goals for a rating score that will help determine whether or not i pursue a certain task or activity 
    3. To have better analytics capabilities than a number score and a mood value over a time period
