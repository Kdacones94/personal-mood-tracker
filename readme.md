# Activity Log

## Creating an Activity Log 
> This activity log will contain the information that will be stored and used to help track my moods and activities throughout the day

### Why? 
- To allow for visualization of the data to see relationships between things I'm doing and how it affects my mood
- To add features to the current app that only allows for activities to be rated and grouped. Example:
    1. To Allow for clearer groupings of moods and activities without redundancies
    2. To create a data model that can be expanded to include a task management system. The system maps the data onto values and goals for a rating score that will help determine whether or not i pursue a certain task or activity 
    3. To have better analytics capabilities than a number score and a mood value over a time period
